# Burkina Faso Anticipatory Action: flooding

## Directory structure

The code in this repository is organized as follows:

```shell

├── analysis      # Main repository of analytical work for the AA pilot
├── docs          # .Rmd files or other relevant documentation
├── exploration   # Experimental work not intended to be replicated
├── src           # Code to run any relevant data acquisition/processing pipelines
|
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt

```

## Reproducing this analysis

Install the requirements with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, install any code in `src` using the command:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

## Development

All code is formatted according to black and flake8 guidelines.
The repo is set-up to use pre-commit.
Before you start developing in this repository, you will need to run

```shell
pre-commit install
```

The `markdownlint` hook will require
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
to be installed on your computer.

You can run all hooks against all your files using

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

It is also **strongly** recommended to use `jupytext`
to convert all Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) to Markdown files (`.md`)
before committing them into version control. This will make for
cleaner diffs (and thus easier code reviews) and will ensure that cell outputs aren't
committed to the repo (which might be problematic if working with sensitive data).
